# Week 1
 > May 7th
 - Project and project repository created.
 - Necessary files created (readme, changelog, licenses)
 > May 10th
 - Created the main menu wireframe
 - Updated licenses with icons used in main menu wireframe
 > Summary (Written May 10th)
 - Slow week in terms of app production due to getting the project proposal done. A little behind on my desired weekly milestone goal as I    wanted to have created all the wireframes this week. Next week will be a much more productive week now that the project proposal is out    of the way.
